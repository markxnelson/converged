## Task 4: Explore Spring Eureka Service Registry

xyz

1. Start a port-forward tunnel to access the Eureka web user interface

   Start the tunnel using this command.  You can run this in the background if you prefer.

    ```
    $ <copy>kubectl -n eureka port-forward svc/eureka 8080:8761</copy>
    ```

   Open a web broswer to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the Eureka web user interface.  It will appear similar to the image below.

   TODO replace this image with one that shows all service deployed.
